Screenshot images for the landing page
======================================

Copy these 3 images from your Cursor project assets folder into this folder and rename them as follows:

1. e__development_Occupancy-official_Screenshot_2026-02-08_192448.png
   -> rename to: screenshot-dashboard.png
   (Department Capacity vs Occupancy dashboard)

2. e__development_Occupancy-official_Screenshot_2026-02-08_192727.png
   -> rename to: screenshot-chart.png
   (Number of Desks over time – bar chart)

3. e__development_Occupancy-official_Untitled-1.png
   -> rename to: screenshot-table.png
   (Department occupancy table Mon–Fri)

Source folder (if saved by Cursor): 
  C:\Users\adael\.cursor\projects\e-development-Occupancy-official\assets\

After copying, the landing page will display all three screenshots in the "See Occupancy in action" section.
